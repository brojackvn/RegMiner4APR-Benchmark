Welcome to univocity-parsers
============================

univocity-parsers is a collection of extremely fast and reliable parsers for Java. It provides a consistent interface for handling different file formats,
and a solid framework for the development of new parsers.

We have finally updated the tutorial, please go to our website:

https://www.univocity.com/pages/parsers-tutorial

**Bugs, contributions & support**

If you find a bug, please report it on github or send us an email on parsers@univocity.com.

We try out best to eliminate all bugs as soon as possible and you’ll rarely see a bug open for more than 24 hours after it’s reported. We do our best to answer all questions. Enhancements/suggestions are implemented on a best effort basis.

Fell free to submit your contribution via pull requests. Any little bit is appreciated, from improvements on documentation to a full blown rewrite from scratch.

For commercial support, customizations or anything in between, please contact support@univocity.com.

**Thank you for using our parsers!**

The univocity team.
