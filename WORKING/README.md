**Faithful spirit**, Mongo query language isn't available in Java, Jongo fixes that. Copy/paste your queries to string.

**Object oriented**, Save & find objects into & from collections. Use embedded Jackson marshalling or your own.

**Wood solid**, As fast as Mongo Java driver. Open source, fully tested & made of rock solid libraries.
